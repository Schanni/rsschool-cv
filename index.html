        <h2>Breefly about myself</h2>
        <p>I am working as an accountant. Sometimes I enjoy my job, sometimes not. I love to learn and to do something new, and often a new activity takes all my thoughts. Front-end for me have always been an attractive and a magical area. Several years ago I have been already studied web design and wanted to start coding, also I have been studied HTML and CSS by myself, but sircumstanses pushed me back to accounting. And nowdays I feel it's time to learn again.</p>
